# Immigrant or expat?
 
What is the power of language? Why do we choose a word instead of another? How does media affect our perception of these different words with same meaning? And how inconsciously racist are we when we choose a word over another?

This game is an artistic project that wants to underline how society, media and our own experience of the world shapes our mind.
If I say "John is a migrant" or "John is an expat" how do you picture John in your head? Does he look the same?

The faces I present here are not real. They are the creation of a machine learning model. They have been generated drawing from two different datasets of portraits. In one dataset the people portaied were tagged as "immigrant", while in the other one as "expat". We might say that the machine that generated these images is as biased as human beings.

This experiment was made possible thanks to Runway ML.
