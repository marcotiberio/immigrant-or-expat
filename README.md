# Immigrant or expat?
 
<p>What is the power of language? Why do we choose a word instead of another? How does media affect 
our perception of different words with same meaning? And how inconsciously biased are we when we choose 
a word over another?

<p>This is an experimental project that wants to underline how society, media and our own experience of the 
world shapes our mind, often also in a biased manner. 
<br>If I say "John is a migrant" or "John is an expat" how do you picture John in your head? Does he look 
the same? Why do you choose to use migrant instead of expat?</p>
<br>
<p>The persons here portrayed are not real, of course. They are the creation of a machine learning model, 
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network" target="_blank"><u>GAN</u></a>. 
They have been generated drawing from two different datasets of portraits. In one dataset the people portaied 
were tagged as "immigrant", while in the other one as "expat". In such a process where you can generate images 
on a very bug scale, it’s easier to understand the bias permeating these two words.

<p>With this work, I’d like to raise awareness about how a preconceived idea of wealth is often attached 
to the language we use, and the power this idea has in shaping our mind regarding other people.
