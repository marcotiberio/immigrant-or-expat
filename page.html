            I wanted to use an AI to generate fake portraits of refugees. I wanted to show both side of AI: the "healing" side, 
            through which you can remember those who lost their lives to reach a better one. But also the "evil" side, showing 
            how easy it is to trick people with fake imagery. 
            <br>The photos here are a creation of an AI algorythm based on two 
            datasets. The datasets are composed by images downloaded from the internet and corresponding to the tags "refugee" 
            and "migrant". 
            <br>The faces created from the two datasets hold very similar physical appearances: darker skin, young age, 
            empty stare. Because these fake faces are based on photos taken and tagged by human beings, I realised there is a very 
            precise and preconceived idea of what a refugee looks like. And that mostly, we tend to just mix the two terms, even 
            if they hold a different meaning. Or is it maybe just more attention-grabbing to tag a kid from Sudan as "refugee".
