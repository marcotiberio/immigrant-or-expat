                <p>I wanted to use machine learning to generate fake portraits of refugees. A GAN, General Adversarial Network, is a a class of machine learning 
                systems whose goal is to generate data from scratch, mostly images. Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set.</p>

                <p>I wanted to show the two sides of machine learning: good and evil.
                The "good" side, the healing one, creating imagery to remember those unknown persons who lost their lives to reach a better one. 
                The "evil" side, creating imagery to show how easy it is to trick people.</p>
                <p>The photos I generated draw from two different datasets. The datasets are composed by images downloaded 
                from the internet and corresponding to the tags "refugee" and "migrant".</p>
                <p>The faces created from the two datasets hold very similar physical appearances: darker skin, young age, 
                empty stare. Because these fake faces are based on photos taken and tagged by human beings, I realised there is a very 
                precise and preconceived idea of what a refugee looks like. And that mostly, we tend to just mix the two terms, even 
                if they hold a different meaning. Or is it maybe just more attention-grabbing to tag a kid from Sudan as "refugee".</p>
